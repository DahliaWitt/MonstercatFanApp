## Overview

The Monstercat Fan App was a project created for the Monstercat Community. It serves as a central point for all things Monstercat and as a quick way to access many sub features. The app is not endorsed or associated with Monstercat. 

## Framework

The app itself is built on the Ionic Framework. It is a hybrid app meaning that it is a combination of HTML5, CSS, and Javascript in order to create the app. The logic is handled by AngularJS.

## Installation

1) Install NPM
2) Install Cordova (npm install cordova)
3) Install Ionic (npm install ionic)
4) cd to dirrectory you cloned to
5) Add your platform of choice (cordova platform add INSERT_PLATFORM_HERE)
6) You can emulate or view the app with Ionic.

## Documentation

I've commented on most of the project files. If you have any questions on what a certian function does please contact me :).

## Contributors

This can become a community project in a way. If you add an aspect to the project that I like I'll publish it in the next app update. Just submit a merge request.

## License

You are *not* allowed to redistribute the app. By redistribution I mean blatantly packaging the app and submiting it to the store with no or little changes as another Monstercat app. Feel free to use it as a referance to start a project or to use code snippets from.
